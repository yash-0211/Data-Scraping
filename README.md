# Web data Scraping using Python
### Aim
Programmatically analyze the file and print in console the name and position of employees-  
a) who has worked for 7 consecutive days.  
b) who have less than 10 hours of time between shifts but greater than 1 hour.  
c) who has worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift.  
      
Python Notebook has been used to solve the assignment (main.pynb file).  
The Output.txt file has the desired output of the code.  
I have also added the file in .py format (main.py) so the viewer can read the python code easily.
